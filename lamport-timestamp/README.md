## Lamport Timestamp

This project implements a toy version of Leslie Lamport's timestamp algorithm for distributed computing as described
in ["Time, Clock, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System"](http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/time-clocks.pdf).

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
