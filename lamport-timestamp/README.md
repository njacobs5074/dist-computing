## Lamport Timestamp

This project implements a toy version of Leslie Lamport's timestamp algorithm for distributed computing as described in hist landmark paper ["Time, Clock, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System"](http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/time-clocks.pdf) (1978).

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can:
- Compile the code with `sbt compile`
- Test it with `sbt test`
- Run it with `sbt run`

`sbt console` will start the Scala REPL.
